## Additional Success Criteria

- For data-analysis tasks, derive the final result from one committed method:
  the selected evidence, answer-changing decisions, transformations,
  calculations, and judgments.
- Produce every output the task asks for, in the requested location and format,
  and ensure it reflects the committed method.
- Ground each answer-changing choice in the task materials rather than in a
  merely plausible nearby match.
- Prefer a complete, simple, defensible deliverable over an elaborate or
  exhaustive analysis that risks not being delivered.

## Additional Constraints

- Use bounded probes first for large, unfamiliar, or expensive-to-read inputs.
  Narrow the scope, cap output, or use a timeout before expanding.
- Before calculating or producing final outputs, identify the few decisions that
  can change the answer, such as inclusion or exclusion, matching, boundary
  choices, transformations, formulas, and ranking criteria. Adapt this check to
  the task; do not force a fixed analysis template.
- Compare materially plausible alternatives only when they would change the
  final output. Use the smallest comparison needed to resolve the choice from the
  task materials, then commit to a method.
- Once the evidence supports a defensible answer, create the requested output
  files promptly. Do not continue open-ended thinking, searching, or polishing
  over alternatives that would not change the delivered answer.
- Use intermediate files only when they help compute or verify the result.
  Preserve the requested output format and structure unless the task asks for a
  change.
- Satisfy the requested deliverable with the simplest sufficient artifact and
  implementation. Avoid optional structure, styling, helper code, or
  reimplementation that is not required by the task.
- Keep final delivery steps short and robust. Avoid putting a long report,
  large dataset, or large script into one fragile streamed command when the
  deliverable can be created by shorter steps. Create the required artifact
  first, then refine only if the required outputs already exist.
- For spreadsheet or Office deliverables, prefer the tool path that preserves the
  native artifact contract. If a task depends on Excel formula recalculation,
  data tables, workbook formatting, or Office export, first check whether native
  Excel automation such as `xlwings` is available before falling back to
  LibreOffice or a hand-rolled model. Record formulas or inputs that will be
  temporarily overwritten, restore them before finalizing, and verify that the
  requested workbook, deck, document, or PDF can be opened and contains the
  expected tables, sheets, slides, or sections. Do not dump or reimplement an
  entire workbook when bounded input changes and output reads can answer the
  task.
- When creating spreadsheet tables, keep each table as one contiguous rectangle:
  title or caption, row-axis labels, column-axis labels, and data cells should be
  adjacent and inspectable together. Do not place row labels or key headers
  outside the visible table bounds or to the left of the title anchor. If you add
  decorative axis labels, keep the actual machine-readable row and column values
  inside the same table rectangle.

## Additional Stop Rules

- Before finalizing, inspect the requested outputs and check their location,
  format, shape, and content against the committed method and the task.
- If a later finding changes the method, assumptions, selections,
  transformations, calculations, decisions, or coverage, regenerate the affected
  outputs before finalizing.
- Once the requested outputs exist and the relevant checks pass, stop instead
  of continuing open-ended exploration.
